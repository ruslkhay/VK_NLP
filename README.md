Course materials "Modern NLP. Large language models"
This course will help you begin to understand the structure of large language models (LLM) and allow you to build your own! As always, leading expert practitioners from VK teach.
Throughout the semester we will review and compare different LLMs. Let's figure out how they work, why some systems are better than others, and how to train your own LLM assistant. Let's look under the hood of models from the BERT and GPT families, and also try to optimize the training and inference of models using new approaches.
